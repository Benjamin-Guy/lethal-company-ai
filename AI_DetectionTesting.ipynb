    "# Item detection\n",
    "Scrap items appear to all appear at roughly the same shape, size, and colour. This suggests template matching as a solution. However, upon examining the training images, it was noted that each scrap item had the exact same colour albeit for a small difference observed in one case. This suggests that precise colour thresholding will be very effective at isolating the scrap items from the rest of the image. The steps for the item detection are as follows:\n",
